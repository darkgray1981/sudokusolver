# sudokusolver
Sudoku Solver desktop app

A simple Windows desktop application written in C# that will allow the computer to solve a sudoku problem from a given starting board.

* Left-click to increase the digit of a position.
* Right-click to decrease the digit of a position.
* Leave positions blank to let the app come up with the proper digit for a solution.
* Click Solve to start the computation process.

If digits are showing up red, it means the starting position has no possible solution, and requires adjustments to be made before continuing.
